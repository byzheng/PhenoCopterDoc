As the limited space in the active storage and the old flights are unlikely viewed in the future, all flight data in the hard drive is archived into a `tar` file, transfered into long-term storage (e.g. tape) and deleted from the active storage to save space. The meta-data and extracted phenotypic values are still stored in the database. 

The data in the hard drive can be retrieved through request.
