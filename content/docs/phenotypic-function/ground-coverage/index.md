Ground coverage is defined as the ratio of green pixel in the certain area and calculated using decision-tree-based segmentation model (DTSM) algorithm developed by Guo et al. 2013. The decision tree algorithm is used to cluster each pixel into two groups (i.e. vegetation and background). The algorithm is originally developed using MatLab by Guo et al. 2013, rewrote using R by Duan et al. 2017.
